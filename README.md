The Dutton Volunteer Portal will be a website designed for volunteers at Dutton Christian
School. They will sign in through Google and will be either a user or an administrator. The
user view will consist of the categories of volunteer work, and the user will select which
categories of work he/she is available to do. It should also have a form for a user to enter the name of their business and
the services it provides. The admin view will display all the different volunteer categories and the names of the 
volunteers under each category that they signed up for. The admins will use this to contact individuals that have signed
up for that particular category. There will also be a display for businesses and their services. A stretch goal would also be
to add a way for an admin to add new volunteer categories and to view individual jobs.

The team members for this project are Ethan Clark, Benjamin Kastner, Kyle Reitsma, and Mitch Stark.

The design.md file can be found in the project directory in this repo.
